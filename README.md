## Takeaways:

> #### I like bootstrap more than material ui
   * Bootstrap has Navbar component
   * Bootstrap feels more complete and full than material

> #### I enjoy Vue js for smaller projects, but I do like React for larger scale projects
   * React feels like it has more working extensions
   * Css frameworks are more complete for react
   * Although its less intuitive I like how the React router works more than the Vue router
   * useEffect is pretty cool ðŸ˜Ž
